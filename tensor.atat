you know , one of the great great great good ones travel and one of the the great pleasure in eth@@ no@@ graph@@ y research is to live together with people who still remember the old days . the past still feel in the wind , they &apos;re tou@@ ched by the rain , they &apos;re tou@@ ching a touch in the plants of plants . 
just that you know that ja@@ gu@@ ese sh@@ am@@ y still travel beyond the mil@@ ky way or the meaning of my@@ ths of in@@ u@@ it is still very important , or in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the budd@@ h@@ ist still follow the har@@ d@@ ma means the central open@@ ness of anthropo@@ log@@ y in the world , that we &apos;re not just going to be able to call the idea that we live in a certain sense of life , but that we don &apos;t just think that we &apos;re not just successful in a certain sense of the world , but we &apos;re not just going to have a certain sense of the world , but that we &apos;re not just successful in a certain sense of our understanding that we &apos;re not just as a group of the world . 
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tation . 
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world . 
we &apos;re running through the ini@@ tial ritu@@ als . 
we need to connect with the un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment separ@@ ation through death and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing dance and art . 
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ton@@ ic case of the love , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture . 
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the pen@@ cil of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ om@@ et@@ tes in haiti , or the war in the ca@@ ka@@ is@@ -@@ desert from north kenya , the cur@@ ri@@ os in the an@@ os or a car@@ a@@ eg@@ g in the middle of the sahar@@ a in the sahar@@ a , this is a month ago , or the col@@ om@@ mate in the middle of the sahar@@ a , or a , i &apos;m in the middle of the sahar@@ an africa , or a , that i &apos;m in the middle of the sahar@@ an africa .
